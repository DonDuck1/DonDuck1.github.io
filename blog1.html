      <img class="blogimg" src="./images/ehealth.jpg" alt="Logo of E-health Ventures Group">
      <p class="blogpostparagraph">E-health Ventures Group is a company that creates accessible e-health platforms where people can find the right solution to their medicinal 
        problems through the combination of specialist medical knowledge, products, information, and advice. This makes self-care easier and more accessible, which enables consumers 
        to come to an appropriate and safe decision to increase their well-being (which is their goal). They divide their roles into 2 categories: Front-End Developer and Back-End 
        Developer. The Front-End Developer is responsible for the visible parts of their products, the Back-End Developer is responsible for making functionable code and maintaining
        that code. Products of them (will) include "De Online Dokter", "mensam.eu", "A SkinCare platform" (currently Work In Progress), "A platform about aging in a healthy way" 
        (still only an idea) and "A platform about fertility" (still only an idea). These projects are (/will be) active in 14 countries. Working on the projects are around 50 
        employees, spread between 2 offices located in breda and Cura√ßao. These employees have (according to the company) a lot of freedom, flexible hours and a budget to further 
        their education. They (apparently) also value the personality of an employee just as much as their knowledge, since they lay a big focus on teamwork: "Our open office culture 
        is characterised by entrepreneurship and teamwork."</p>

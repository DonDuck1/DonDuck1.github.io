        <h2 class="smalltitlehome">Welcome to my website</h2>
        <p class="paragraphhome">My name is Joan Maljers (see also: <a class="normallink" href="./profile.html">Profile</a>) and I want to welcome you to my website. I'm currently 
          following the study "HBO-ICT" at the HZ in Middelburg (the logo of which you'll find on the "blog" page\) and have created this website for an assignment. You'll find the 
          navigation bar at the top and an aside menu with useful links on the right (where the arrow was pointing). On this page, I'll try to convince you that the study "HBO-ICT" 
          is a good pick for me.
        </p>
        <h2 class="secondarysmalltitlehome">My motivation</h2>
        <p class="paragraphhome">First, I want to talk about my motivation for picking the study "HBO-ICT". I've always wanted to do something with computers as my study ever since I 
          first owner my own computer (when I was around 12 years old). I was absolutely fascinated by the things a computer could do, though, as a 12-year old boy, mostly about how 
          you could play games that somehow were so creative and fun. Growing up I began having ideas about how those games could be improved and even ideas for original, new games.
          I didn't know how to though, which made me frustrated. Growing up even more, I kind of lost the feeling of fascination about games and I began thinking I had seen everything 
          in games. Games were becoming less fun for me. Indie games and mods for games removed that feeling however with how original and fun they could be. I began looking into how
          to create mods myself and actually made some myself, learning to program a bit along the way. The feeling of programming something and then have that visibly reflected on 
          the screen was fun and made me proud of myself. Having others interact with the things I created and giving feedback that they were having fun with it made me even prouder 
          of myself for creating something others enjoyed. So really, my motivation for the study HBO-ICT is that I'd like to learn how to program to be able to actually create the 
          things I think of that would be helpful and/or fun (to others) and make me proud of myself.
        </p>
        <h2 class="secondarysmalltitlehome">Proof that ICT is the study for me</h2>
        <p class="paragraphhome">For programming, abstract thinking and problem-solving capability are important. Subjects like maths or physics will teach you those skills. I had
          both of those subjects at high schools (in the case of maths the "B"-variant, which is focused on (the manipulation of) functions and formula, both of which can be quite
          important in programming) and I finished both with good marks. Another thing which will help me during my study is my prior programming experience with making mods, I've
          made 4 small ones and 1 big one in total and while working on them I've worked with variables, if-functions and (while-)loops for example (see also: <a class="normallink" 
          href="./blog4.html">Programming experience</a>). Knowing about these and how they can be used will be helpful during the first part of my study. I do have to say that the 
          game I've modded was created with the idea that modding should be easy, so while I might know how to do things in that "environment", I don't know whether all of the skills 
          I've learnt from modding will transfer over to actual programming.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphlisthome">So, to summarize:</p>
        <ul class="listhome">
          <li>My motivation for learning how to program is being able to create original things that I've thought of that would be helpful and/or fun (to others and me), which would
              make me proud of myself.
          </li>
          <li>Maths and physics (which I passed with good marks) learnt me to think outside the box ("abstract thinking") and increased my problem-solving capability.</li>
          <li>My prior programming experience (modding games) will help me for at least the first quartile of my study, though not everything I've learnt might transfer over to "real"
              programming.
